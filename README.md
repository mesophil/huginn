## Why huginn and not a prebuilt object detection camera?
Object detection cameras start at ~[US$300](https://www.alibaba.com/product-detail/Object-recognition-data-management-AI-tracking_1600119050822.html "One example we found"), while our system can be assembled for ~CA$160 ($100 raspberry pi, and two $30 pi cameras).
